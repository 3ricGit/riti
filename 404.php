                                RITI Association is a project of St Nicholas Rehabilitation Center, and Nursing Home
                                with an aim to address the problem of unemployment and financial difficulties
                                encountered by Kenyan youth. According to the United Nations, the latest statistics, 87%
                                of the world's youth population live on less than 1 dollar per day. The millennium
                                development goals identify youth as among the most vulnerable sectors of the African
                                population upon whom issues such as poverty, hunger, lack of education, maternal
                                mortality, unemployment, and HIV&AIDS have an afar more significant impact.

                                Empowering African youth is one of the most serious challenges facing the African
                                continent today. While we have made strides in proving access to education, we have
                                not matched this with providing equal access to employment.

                                Young Africans enter the workforce at a faster rate than jobs created. Currently, 40
                                million
                                young people are out of work. The rise in the number of unemployed youth is directly
                                proportional to the rising insecurity, hopelessness, and despair that is manifesting in
                                violence and insecurity across the continent.

                                Simply, Africa is unable to generate enough jobs to accommodate a large number of people
                                graduating from colleges and universities. Due to the high number of unemployment, youth
                                have turned to alcoholism and drug abuse, robbers, members of terrorist groups and
                                kidnappers, among other vices. Girls have turned to early marriages that are not
                                sustainable, resulting in bringing up fatherless kids hence high risks to HIV/AIDS
                                infection.

                                RITI association aims to solve drug addiction menace and high rate of unemployment by
                                bringing together and re-grouping affected youths into diverse professionals to initiate
                                various business enterprises as a group. The association will also provide
                                career-building through internship opportunities.
