                  <h1>Why RITI Association ?</h1>
              <div class="about-description-content">
                <p>
                RITI Association is a project of St Nicholas Rehabilitation Center, and Nursing Home with an aim to address the problem of unemployment and financial difficulties encountered by Kenyan youth. According to the United Nations, the latest statistics, 87% of the world's youth population live on less than 1 dollar per day. The millennium development goals identify youth as among the most vulnerable sectors of the African population upon whom issues such as poverty, hunger, lack of education, maternal mortality, unemployment, and HIV&AIDS have an afar more significant impact. 
               </p> 
               <p>
               Empowering African youth is one of the most serious challenges facing the African 
               continent today. While we have made strides in proving access to education, we have
                not matched this with providing equal access to employment.
               </p>
               <p>
               Young Africans enter the workforce at a faster rate than jobs created. Currently, 40 million
                young people are out of work. The rise in the number of unemployed youth is directly 
                proportional to the rising insecurity, hopelessness, and despair that is manifesting in 
                violence and insecurity across the continent. 
               </p>
               <p>
               Simply. Africa is unable to generate enough jobs to accommodate a large number of people graduating from colleges and universities. Due to the high number of unemployment, youth have turned to alcoholism and drug abuse,  robbers, members of terrorist groups and kidnappers, among other vices. Girls have turned to early marriages that are not sustainable, resulting in bringing up fatherless kids hence high risks to HIV/AIDS infection.
               </p>

               <p>
               RITI association aims to solve drug addiction menace and high rate of unemployment by bringing together and re-grouping affected youths into diverse professionals to initiate various business enterprises as a group. The association will also provide career-building through internship opportunities.
